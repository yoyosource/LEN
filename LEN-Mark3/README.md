# LENmk3 (LixEntNow Mark 3)
Finished building on 28 August of 2021

## Instruction Set
- +1 -> increment current cell (Value in Composter: 3)
- -1 -> decrement current cell (Value in Composter: 5)
- rotate -> rotate to next cell (Value in Composter: 6)
- input -> wait on change and read input and put value in currently active cell (Value in Composter: 7)
- output -> write current cell value to output (Value in Composter: 4)
- while -> starts a do while loop (Value in Composter: 1)
- endwhile -> ends a do while loop, jumps back if current cell is not ZERO (Value in Composter: 2)
